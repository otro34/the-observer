Any code file that you need in order to accomplish the task, should be put here. 

These files should be of generic use, and if you need to create one, document it so it can be reused. Always review to check if you already have here something that you need here (For example: A Python script that writes to the CSV file should only be written here once, and the reused afterwards).
